## the 9 commandments of Leaderless software development

for a project to be considered "Leaderless":
1, there shall be no owner of the project
2, everyone shall have equal rights to contribute to, administer and get credited for their work in the project
3, there may be groups of contributors(called "delegate groups") with exclusive, **revokable** rights and a clearly stated objective, being the only exception to rule 2
4, the project shall be licensed under CC0 or any public domain license
5, the project shall not contain patents, trademarks, trade secrets or any other form of intellectual property
6, the project shall be transparent to its users about all affairs
7, the project shall be public from the day of its announcement
8, the project shall not make any money(since that would require someone to control the projects bank account)
9, the project shall not affiliate with forprofit, capped profit, or any profit-driven companies
