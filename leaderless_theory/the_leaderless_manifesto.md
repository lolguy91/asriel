# The leaderless manifesto
I, lolguy91 declare that "Leaderless software development" or "Leaderless" for short refers to the way of organizing development defined here.

The 3 guiding principles of Leaderless are the following:
1, Companies always act in their self-interest and may harm the project.
2, Public domain work benefits society while Copyrighted works only benefit the author's bank account.
3, The owner of a project is inflexible, a serious security risk and a roadblock to a smooth development process.

## the criteria for Leaderless software development
for a project to be considered "Leaderless":
1. there shall be no owner of the project
2. everyone shall have equal rights to contribute to, administer and get credited for their work in the project
3. there may be groups of contributors(called "delegate groups") with exclusive, **revocable** rights and a clearly stated objective, being the first exception to rule 2
4. there may be a way for the contributors to forbid a person or group from contributing, that is the second and last exception to rule 2
5. the project shall be licensed under CC0 or any public domain license
6. the project shall not contain patents, trademarks, trade secrets or any other form of intellectual property
7. the project shall be transparent to its users about all affairs
8. if the project has predefined rules there must be a way to make changes to said rules
9. the project shall not affiliate with for-profit, capped-profit, or any profit-driven companies

## Implementation tips

1. It is good to have some kind mechanism for the project to accept and reject contributions
2. If the majority of proposals get passed near-instantly, you are doing something wrong
3. If most contributions are slow to get through, you might want to change the criteria for them passing
