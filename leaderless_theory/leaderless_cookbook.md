# How to make a Leaderlessâ„¢ Project(2024-09-24 draft)
the creation of a leaderless project is fricking hard man. My mission is to find the recipe to success regarding leaderless projects.

## My research
before looking at hte conclusions, you need to understand my way of researching stuff: **I DO NOT write stuff down, I use my head**. You might say that is irresponsible, but I have a lot of material remaining from projects: discord servers/channels, github repos, memories of flamewars.

So, before even coming up with leaderless, I was trying to figure out how to recruit people. I realized the problem is made of 3 parts:

1. How do I aquire a steady stream of interested people?
2. How do I ensure the people are actually competant?
3. How do I ensure my people are willing to contribute?

These were all mysteries, after turning my old project - RoidsOS - anarchist, I identified 2 more problems:

1. there is a huge stigma around the word "anarchist", making it a general deterrent.
2. if the project starts from scratch, the community - even the contributors - will be sceptical.

I also identified 2 more pitfalls:
1. personal projects: since the idea for the project belongs to the person, it will feel more valuable thanks to the pheonomenon I call: "own-idea trap". The "own-idea trap" is the normal person's inability to judge their own ideas, making them think they are geniuses. Hence, **a bored person with no ideas is your best bet**.
2. Premature announcement can devalue your project, because they look at it and think "This is garbage", while your peoject is just unfinished.

## The big idea
The first ieda was a simple one: the private period, it is basically you working alone on the project to make get it to a level where people want to join.

The other idea that suddenly made Leaderles project viable was the idea of the "mystery period": a period where your project is unannounced, but you are recruiting. There are 2 benefits of having such period:
1. In the private period, only you can work on the project, while in the mystery period, you are drawing in people with the mystery of the project, allowing you to not work your butt off.
2. In the mystery period you do not have to be leaderless, the only criterion is to not make the contributors hate you.

## The final (it isnt) formula
you must do the following to make a leaderless project:
1. work on the project in 3 periods: private, mystery and public
2. in the private period, you must work alone to create a base for the project
3. in the mystery period, you must draw in your major contributors to the project, and develop it to an announcable state
4. in the public period, you must announce your project, and make it actually leaderless
5. you must not get involved in any arguments during the mystery period(oh no)
6. you have to prefer people with no original ideas or personal projects when recruiting
7. you must not let incompetant people in
8. you must kick all bad actors while the project is still hierarchical
9. you must get into the public period at the right time: if its too soon, the project will be percieved as bad quality, if you are too late, the contributors will leave the project
10. you must strive for the best quality, especially in the mystery period, because the contributors may reject the project for its messyness
